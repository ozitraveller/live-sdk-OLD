Description: Bootstrap a basic Devuan system
 debootstrap is used to create a Devuan base system from scratch,
 without requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by
 downloading .deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them
 into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.
