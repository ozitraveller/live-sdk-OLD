# Meanwhile, if whatever distro you're working with does weird stuff when
# all you want is a hard coded IPV4 address, consider the following
# distro-independent shellscript, which can be run at boot and also any
# time some foolish daemon thinks it knows more about your desired IP
# address than you do this.

# The preceding sets the box's IP at 192.168.100.6 with an alias at 106,
# and sets the default gateway to 192.168.100.96. The assumed device name
# here is eno1. Obviously, you need to modify it to fit your needs, but
# after that, you can override the inconveniences almost every distro
# throws at you if all you want is a fixed IP address. I've used this
# shellscript in several distros.
